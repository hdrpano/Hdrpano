# DUX-iOS from hdrpano

## What is this
This is a new **SDK DUX** environment, free from old stuff. The original DJI SDK examples have some issues as they were growing from older versions. Now DJI uses dynamic frameworks. That needs clean setups. No bitcode for example. 

This SDK is build from scratch without coping existing code. This SDK has powerful inbuilt functions. We have not be aware of complicated key management functions. This is a easy to use framework. This framework supports online tracking. 

## Timeline
This framework starts with a timeline project. My fast GCD implementation from the hdrpano APP will be part in a second step. 

## GCD
This framework is built on save **GCD** procedures and realtime **IMU** settings. It is made for online tracking like Airmap does. 

This framework supports Handheld and Aircraft devices. 

## Online tracking
This framework is prepared for Airmap use. This means online telemetry. I one or two years many countries will use that. We start in Switzeland this year. 

## The team
For now this framework is supported from hdrpano only. It will be used for software engineers from the HFTM high school. The government in Switzerland supports drone activities. Skyguide needs technicians with drone knowledge. We will implement online tracking in 2019 in Switzerland together with Airmap. Software engineers from other countries are welcomed to join this new framework.
